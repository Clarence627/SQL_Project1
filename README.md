# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics.

Check out my SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/) 

# Questions I want to answer through my SQL query
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

# Tools Used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.

# Analysis

### Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```
ELECT
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
	job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    job_title = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT
	job_id,
	job_title,
	salary_year_avg,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
	job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    job_title = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
        skills_dim.skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```
SELECT
  skills_dim.skills,
  COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
  job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
  job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
  skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
  demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```


### 4. Skills Based on Salary

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```
SELECT
  skills_dim.skills AS skill, 
  ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),2) AS avg_salary
FROM
  job_postings_fact
	INNER JOIN
	  skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
	INNER JOIN
	  skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
  job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
  AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
	-- AND job_work_from_home = True  -- optional to filter for remote jobs
GROUP BY
  skills_dim.skills 
ORDER BY
  avg_salary DESC; 
```
